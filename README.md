# Retro

Retro is a library that ties together different components that are needed to build web apps that use backend to generate all the content. It is named *Retro* because it lets us build apps like we did in early 2000s, but with far  superior development experience.

Building blocks of Retro:

1. **Sitemap** enables file system based routing, provided by [Sitemap package](https://github.com/activecollab/sitemap),
1. **Form processing** using a simple mechanism to capture data from forms, validate it, and re-render the form with errors when needed.
